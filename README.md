# Reinforcement_learning_2023_2024
The creation of a reinforcement learning agent through the medium of games

# Project Description
Our goal is to take a premade (Python) Snake game (found under snakeRL.py) and use reinforcement learning to achieve as high a score as we can in Snake.
These methods will hopefully motivate future applications of reinforcement learning to other games.

# HOW TO USE
**WIP**
